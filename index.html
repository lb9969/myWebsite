Dogs Have a Strong Sense of Smell. Scientists report that a dog's sense of smell is 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than a human's. One of the reasons a dog has a much better smelling ability than we do has to do with the number of scent receptors: For every scent receptor a human has, a dog has about 50.

some people are allergic to dogs but it depends what type of dog it is. Most poeple are allergic to Basset Hound, Boston Terrier ,Bulldog, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Pekingese and Pug because they have a lot of hair on there bodies. Some dogs dont have as much hair as they do.
