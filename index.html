<h3>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Dogs can live up to 10 – 13 years!

Dogs Have a Strong Sense of Smell. Scientists report that a dog's sense of smell is 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than a human's. One of the reasons a dog has a much better smelling ability than we do has to do with the number of scent receptors: For every scent receptor a human has, a dog has about 50.

some people are allergic to dogs but it depends what type of dog it is. Most poeple are allergic to Basset Hound, Boston Terrier ,Bulldog, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Pekingese and Pug because they have a lot of hair on there bodies. Some dogs dont have as much hair as they do.
